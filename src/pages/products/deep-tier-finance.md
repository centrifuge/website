# What is Deep Tier Finance?

Deep Tier Finance is an innovative financing solution for locked-up working capital in supply chains. As trust and reputation of large companies ripple down the supply chain through transparent business relations, blockchain-based Deep Tier Finance enables financing at better rates, deeper into the supply chain. Deep Tier Finance is made possible by Centrifuge OS, a decentralized, trustless blockchain-based technology that provides an immutable, censorship-resistant, single source of truth for all participants of the network.

Traditional vs Deep Tier Financing
</Heading>

Traditional supply chain finance models rarely reach beyond the first-tier suppliers of large corporates, and thus exclude the long tail and deeper tiers. Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises, often located in emerging and frontier markets, represent the biggest portion of these deeper tiers and are in most need of access to capital. Deep Tier Finance tackles this problem.

# How does Deep Tier Finance work?

Through the use of Centrifuge OS, an open blockchain protocol for supply chains, suppliers will be able to easily prove their credit-worthiness as they build a reputation with their customers over time, and this, in turn, will help to obtain financing. In addition, the trust and reputation of large companies ripple down the supply chain through interconnected business relations. Business sensitive information is selectively shared and verified immutably on-chain.

Imagine a simplified sneaker supply chain, from a Cotton Grower to a large Sneaker producer. Products are being delivered and invoices issued constantly throughout the supply chain. There is also an external “Funder” such as a factor. All entities are connected by the decentralized Centrifuge OS and share selected, encrypted data, such as outstanding amounts and due dates readable only to the next intermediary in the chain. No sensible data, such as materials or quantities are revealed - companies retain full sovereignty over their data.

Cotton Grower sends an early payment request to Fabric. This request is matched with outstanding amounts between Fabric and Laces and passed through the supply chain until it reaches Sneaker. Sneaker, can either finance the request from their excess liquidity (Dynamic Discounting approach) or confirm their willingness to pay their outstanding invoice from Laces to Funder (Reverse Factoring approach). Funder then provides financing for a rate based on Sneakers credit risk. This financing is passed back through the supply chain, until it reaches Cotton Grower.

For facilitating this transaction, Laces can charge a small fee on this transaction.", "Sneakers confirms the early payment request to Laces and settles the transaction by paying the invoice from Laces early."] }} />

Centrifuge OS is an open, decentralized platform to connect the global financial supply chain. It provides participants with an immutable, censorship-resistant, single source of truth for shared documents like invoices and purchase orders - the missing technology to enable Deep Tier Finance. This allows all tiers of a supply chain to interact with each other without giving up ownership of their data. No centralized entity will be needed anymore to coordinate between participants and extract rents.
