Creating a new system for the global financial supply chain is only possible through the collaboration of a global community of organizations, groups and individuals. We want to encourage the exchange of ideas and build Centrifuge as an inclusive, welcoming, and safe community.

Our Slack Community is a place where you can meet, chat and explore.

Any harmful or discriminating behavior will not be tolerated and will result in the offending person(s) being expelled from the community.
