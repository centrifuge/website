This *Data Privacy Policy* outlines how personal data is processed when this website is used.

Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (Article 4(1) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)). This includes information such as your name, your e-mail address, your postal address, or your telephone number. It does not include information which cannot be linked directly to a natural person’s identity, such as the number of persons visiting this website.

### Third-party Services and Cross-Border Data Processing

In the event that we use third-party services to process personal data, the data is only disclosed to the extent permitted by data protection regulations.

This includes officially recognized levels of data protection such as provided through the “Privacy Shield” for the US, or compliance with officially recognized special contractual standards.

- Users have the right to request the completion or correction of incomplete or incorrect data.
- Users have the right to request the deletion of their data.

### Cookies

Cookies are saved on the user’s computer when using our website. Cookies are small text files that are saved on the user’s computer and through which the party setting the cookie receives certain information. Cookies cannot run programs or transmit viruses to the user’s computer. They are used to make websites more user-friendly and effective as a whole.

By using our website and agreeing to this policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.

However, the user can delete cookies using the respective web browser function, restrict the usage of cookies in its web browser cookie settings, or use our cookie setting menu in the footer of the website to do so. This may cause restrictions in the full functionality of this website.

### Deletion of Data
    
Personal data processed by Centrifuge is deleted as soon as there is no need to store the data anymore – as is the case, for example, for an email address when the user has unsubscribed from our newsletter. We do, however, respect statutory storage requirements.

### Comments and Posts

IP addresses or other device identifiers of users leaving comments or posting content on this website might be stored. This is for our security, in the event that a user submits illegal content. The data is permanently stored together with the comment or post as long as the user does not dissent.

### Newsletter

Users can leave their email address to receive our email newsletter. The user’s consent is verified by an opt-in email, whereby the user confirms the email address. The user can unsubscribe at any time and request the deletion of the email address.

Sending the newsletter is performed by „MailChimp“, a US newsletter service provider operated by Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA (MailChimp data privacy policy: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy). The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a MailChimp is certified for and operates under the “Privacy Shield” agreement, and guarantees to obtain EU data regulations (www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG&status=Active).

The newsletter service provider might use recipient’s data in a pseudonymous form, meaning without assignment to a user, to optimize or improve their own services. However, the newsletter service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.
