          In the event that we use third-party services to process personal
          data, the data is only disclosed to the extent permitted by data
          protection regulations.&nbsp;Data processing outside the European

          the extent permitted by data protection regulations unless the user
          provides their consent. This includes officially recognized levels of
          data protection such as provided through the “Privacy Shield” for the
          US, or compliance with officially recognized special contractual
          standards.

          Cookies are saved on the user’s computer when using our website.
          Cookies are small text files that are saved on the user’s computer and
          through which the party setting the cookie receives certain

          use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this policy.

        <p>
          However, the user can delete cookies using the respective web browser

          <strong>Deletion of Data</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Personal data processed by Centrifuge is deleted as soon as there is
          no need to store the data anymore – as is the case, for example, for
          an email address when the user has unsubscribed from our newsletter.
          We do, however, respect statutory storage requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Comments and Posts</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          IP addresses or other device identifiers of users leaving comments or
          posting content on this website might be stored. This is for our
          security, in the event that a user submits illegal content. The data
          is permanently stored together with the comment or post as long as the
          user does not dissent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Newsletter</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Users can leave their email address to receive our email newsletter.
          The user’s consent is verified by an opt-in email, whereby the
          user&nbsp;confirms the email address. The user can unsubscribe&nbsp;at
          any time and request the deletion of the email address.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sending the newsletter is performed by „MailChimp“, a US newsletter
          service provider operated by Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De
          Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA (MailChimp data privacy
          policy: https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy). The Rocket Science Group
          LLC d/b/a MailChimp is certified for and operates under the “Privacy
          Shield” agreement, and guarantees to obtain EU data regulations
          (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TO6hAAG&amp;status=Active).
        </p>
        <p>
          The newsletter service provider might use recipient’s data in a
          pseudonymous form, meaning without assignment to a user, to optimize
          or improve their own services. However, the newsletter service
          provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address
          them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.
