              <strong>Deletion of Data</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Personal data processed by Centrifuge is deleted as soon as there
              is no need to store the data anymore – as is the case, for
              example, for an email address when the user has unsubscribed from
              our newsletter. We do, however, respect statutory storage
              requirements.

              <strong>Comments and Posts</strong>

            <p>
              IP addresses or other device identifiers of users leaving comments
              or posting content on this website might be stored. This is for
              our security, in the event that a user submits illegal content.
              The data is permanently stored together with the comment or post
              as long as the user does not dissent.

              <strong>Newsletter</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Users can leave their email address to receive our email
              newsletter. The user’s consent is verified by an opt-in email,
              whereby the user confirms the email address. The user can
              unsubscribe at any time and request the deletion of the email
              address.
