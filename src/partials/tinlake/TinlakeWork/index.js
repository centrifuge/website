                  Tinlake is a framework of smart contracts on Ethereum, that turns digital representations of real-world assets (Non-Fungible Tokens) into ERC-20 tokens, which then gives access to decentralized lending protocols. 
               </Paragraph>
               <Paragraph className="tinlake_paragraph">
                  Any asset that can be represented on-chain as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) can be financed using the Tinlake infrastructure. 
               </Paragraph>
               <Paragraph className="tinlake_paragraph">
                  Tinlake enables platforms to pool NFTs in a smart contract and use them as collateral to borrow money in a stable currency such as DAI. In turn for locking in NFTs, the contract mints fungible ERC-20 tokens, called Collateral Value Tokens (CVTs), that each represents a fraction of the bundled collateral.
               </Paragraph>
               <Paragraph className="tinlake_paragraph">
                  The CVTs are then used as collateral and locked into DeFi lending protocols, such as Compound and Maker, to allow instant smart contract based lending.
